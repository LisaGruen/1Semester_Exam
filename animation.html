                <p><br>Project 02.02.01<br><br>

                    This week-submission was divided in many small tasks and gave an overview in storytelling and designing and animating characters. We wrote a short description, of our idea and went from there to a more detailed version of our story. Afterwards, in order to visualise our project we drew our storyboard. With the style tile we defined our design and the characters with a worksheet. With the sprite sheet animation we could make our character alive in a simple way.<br><br>


                    What did I learn<br><br>
                    I learned many new tools on how to develop a character or a story. In the process from the initial idea to an interesting and consistant story you need to consider many details and define the settings you want to work with. In the beginning it is important to decide in what genre or mood you want to work with, what your message is and what dramaturgic elements you want to use. This helps to stay with your plan during the process. The storyboard helps to share your ideas with others in a quick and easy way. The more details, like sound or duration, you already consider while drawing your storyboard the easier it gets to implement and avoid unnessesary or even illogical elements in your work. The same applies to developing a character. Defining the age, the height or weight or even what dessert your character likes helps to create a lively and captivating figure.<br><br>

                    Additionally, I learned methods to sketch and transfer them with Adobe Illustrator to a digital product.<br><br>


                    What would I change today<br><br>
                    I would like to elaborate the sprite sheet animation. It is a nice and relatively easy way to create an animation and it feels like I only scratched on the surface of its possibilities.</p>
