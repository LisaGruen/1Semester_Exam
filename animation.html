                <p><br>Project 02.02.01<br>

                    <br>This week-submission was divided in many small tasks and gave an overview in storytelling and designing and animating characters. We wrote a short description, called logline, of our idea and went from there to a more detailed version of our story. To visualise our project we draw our storyboard afterwards. With the style tile we defined our design and with the worksheet our characters. With the sprite sheet animation we could make our character alive in a simple way.<br>


                    <br>What did I learn<br>
                    <br>I learned many new tools how to develop a character or a story. In the process fom the initial idea to an interesting and consistence story you need to consider many details and define your settings you want to work with. In the beginning it is important to define in what genre or mood you want to work with, what your message is and what dramaturgic elements you want to use. This helps to stay with your plan during the process. The storyboard does the same and helps to share your ideas with others in a quick and easy way. The more details, like sound or duration, you already consider while drawing your storyboard the easier it gets to implement, because can avoid unnessesary or even unlogical elements in your work. The same applies for developing a character. Defining the age, the height or weight or even what dessert your character likes helps to create a lively and captivating figure.<br>

                    <br>Additional, I learned methods to sketch and to transfer them with Adobe Illustrator to a digital product.<br></p>
