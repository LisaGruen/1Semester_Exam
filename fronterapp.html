                <p>04.01.01 Design Sprint<br><br>

                    Task description<br><br>
                    I could not participate during the week and therefore worked alone and went through the single steps of the design sprint afterwards.<br><br>

                    My idea was to focus on the calendar function within fronter. In my concept the calendar combines and structures all functions of the learning management system. It connects for example the teaching material, your submission or your schedule with the calendar. In the calendar you can choose between categories like day, month, semester or even teacher. As a new feature I had the idea to add recordings of the lectures. That could make it possible to return to lessons you missed on a specific day or if the student wants to look something up again.<br><br>


                    My long term goal was to create a better overview of all the function you use every day as a student and with this to make students use fronter more and make their student live easier and more organized.<br><br>

                    What I learned<br><br>
                    Talking with the test persons were a real eye-opener. On the one hand how important it is to show your work to as many persons as possible and conduct user tests. Functions and Design that seems to make sense for yourself does not necessarily make sense for your target group.<br><br>

                    What I would change today?<br><br>
                    The tests showed me, that had problems to find some of the functions. So even though people liked my simple structure and design in general, I made the decision to change the design to make it easier to find all functions. Additional, I could delete some logic errors and overthink naming as for example “portfolio” was misunderstood.

                <p><br>04.02.01 Web Prototype<br>

                    <br>

                    Task description<br><br>
                    In this module we were supposed to code a responsive page based on our prototype and user tests from previous week. Other than the week before this was not a group work.<br><br>


                    What I learned<br><br>
                    This task was great to get more secure in coding, because I had to do it myself. It was a challenge, but saying you only learn it by doing is true in this case. In the previous projects I was avoiding to take the responsibility for the coding part.<br><br>


                    What I would change today?<br><br>
                    I definitely would like to extend the user flow experience with more sub tasks to make the experience more realistic. The messenger page could be more inspired by for example google mail to give a more modern and authentic experience.</p>
