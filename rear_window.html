                    Task description<br><br>
                    This time we created a digital and interactive teaser for the movie Rear Window from Alfred Hitchcock. We had to consider a targetgroup of young adults and motivate them to go in the cinema to watch the movie. Furthermore, we worked out a moodboard, personas collage and a style tile.<br><br>


                    What I learned<br><br>
                    First of all we started to define our target group. This helps within the design process to make decisions or to evaluate the final result. Does the target group feels attracted to the product, do they understand what it is about and would they go and see the movie? <br><br>
                    The moodboard, style tile and storyboard helps to visualise and communicate ideas to the group. Especially, during the process when tasks are divided and several people work on one project.<br><br>

                    We had the chance to present and test our product with users. In this case to some of our classmates. With this peer review we got valuable feedback and improved our page afterwards.<br><br>

                    We worked with Trello and Slack to organize and communicate with the group members.<br><br>

                    Apart from the concept I was part of the design process. I was involved in designing the background and characters. Additional, I was sketching the storyboard and creating the personas collage.<br><br>

                    What I would change today<br><br>
                    I would work over the design. I still like the approach, but in my opinion the characters could need some more details. I would redefine the shapes and maybe add a third colour for a shadow or a highlight to be able to add some more details.
